# AULAB - BLUE PROJECT

I've studied for my very very very first Web Dev experience in Aulab - Italy.

This was one of the projects they gave us to understand better CSS and Bootstrap.

Furthermore they gave us these indications to follow:

`Color:` #1566C0

`Font:` Righteous, Roboto

And than a `"mockup"` of the "outstanding website" to build, here:
